# Script for populating the database. You can run it as:
#
#     mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
#
# Inside the script, you can read and write to any of your
# repositories directly:
#
#     SurveyAPI.Repo.insert!(%SurveyAPI.SomeSchema{})
#
# We recommend using the bang functions (`insert!`, `update!`
# and so on) as they will fail if something goes wrong.

# questions = ""

# data = %{"title" => "Sharing Cities Seeded Survey", "showProgressBar" => "top", "pages" => [%{"questions": questions}]}
# SurveyAPI.Repo.insert!(%SurveyAPI.Surveys.Survey{name: "Sample seed survey",survey_design: data, survey_id: 1})
